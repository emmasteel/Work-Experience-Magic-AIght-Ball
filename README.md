# 🎱 Welcome to the Magic AIght Ball Project! ✨

Hey Microsoft Work Experience gang! 👋 

Welcome to your awesome coding adventure! You're about to build something really cool - an AI-powered Magic 8 Ball web app that can answer questions using artificial intelligence. How magical is that? 🪄

## 🚀 What Are We Building?

We're creating a modern, AI-powered version of the classic Magic 8 Ball toy! Instead of just random responses, our Magic 8 Ball will use AI to give more thoughtful (and fun) answers to questions. Think of it as a wise digital fortune teller! 

## 🏁 Getting Started

### Step 1: Create Your GitHub Account (If You Don't Have One)

GitHub is like a social network for code! Here's how to join:

1. **Go to GitHub**: Visit [github.com](https://github.com) in your web browser
2. **Click "Sign up"**: Look for the green button in the top right corner
3. **Choose your username**: Pick something cool but professional (you might use this for work later!)
4. **Enter your email**: Use an email you check regularly
5. **Create a password**: Make it strong and secure
6. **Verify you're human**: Complete the puzzle (prove you're not a robot!)
7. **Click "Create account"**: You're almost there!
8. **Verify your email**: Check your inbox and click the verification link

🎉 Congratulations! You now have a GitHub account!

### Step 2: Understanding This Repository (Repo)

A **repository** (or "repo" for short) is like a project folder that stores all our code, documents, and project history. Think of it as a time machine for your code - you can see every change that's ever been made!

#### What's in this repo:
- **README.md** (this file!) - Your project guide
- **docs/** folder - Where we keep our planning documents
- Soon: All the cool code for our Magic 8 Ball!

### Step 3: How to Interact with This Repo

#### For Beginners (Web Interface):
1. **Browse files**: Click on files and folders to explore
2. **Read code**: Click on any file to see what's inside
3. **See changes**: Click on "commits" to see the project history
4. **Ask questions**: Use the "Issues" tab to ask questions or report problems

#### For Advanced Users (Git Commands):
If you want to work with the code locally on your computer:

```bash
# Clone this repository to your computer
git clone https://github.com/emmasteel/Work-Experience-Magic-AIght-Ball.git

# Navigate into the project folder
cd Work-Experience-Magic-AIght-Ball

# See what's changed
git status

# Add your changes
git add .

# Save your changes with a message
git commit -m "Describe what you changed"

# Share your changes
git push
```

## 📚 Project Documentation

Check out our planning documents in the `docs/` folder:

- **[Architecture Design](docs/architecture-design.md)** - How we'll structure our app
- **[Frontend Requirements](docs/frontend-requirements.md)** - What the user interface should do
- **[Integration Requirements](docs/integration-requirements.md)** - How different parts work together

## 🎯 Project Goals

By the end of this work experience, you'll have:
- ✅ Learned how to use GitHub
- ✅ Understood how web applications work
- ✅ Built something cool with AI
- ✅ Worked as part of a development team
- ✅ Created something you can show friends and family!

## 🤝 Team Collaboration

Remember, coding is a team sport! Here are some tips:
- **Ask questions** - No question is too small!
- **Help others** - Share your discoveries
- **Be kind** - We're all learning together
- **Have fun** - This should be enjoyable!

## 🆘 Need Help?

- **Stuck on something?** Create an "Issue" in this repo and describe your problem
- **Found a bug?** Let us know in the Issues section
- **Have an idea?** We'd love to hear it!
